Either way, the most likely outcome is a death-sentence or a life-long sentence at the very least.\n[foreigner_murderer_origin.GetName] will most likely not like either outcome for one of their citizens, but we could pull some strings behind the scenes to give the murderer a much more lenient sentence to pacify [foreigner_murderer_origin.GetNameDef]."
